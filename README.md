## Project info

This project is a simple melee fighting game using a saber as a weapon. Defeat the five enemies to win.

To run, download the latest release (only Windows unfortunately), unzip, and run the `ShaderGraph.exe` executable. If you get a SmartScreen warning, it's because I don't pay for an expensive license with Microsoft :)

This project showcases Unity Shader Graph using the Universal Render Pipeline. We were tasked with creating a custom shader for the saber used in the game.

I used Unity NavMeshAgent AI pathfinding to allow the enemies to follow you and attack you when in range.

## Controls

- Space: Extend / retract saber
- WASD: Movement
- Left click: Attack
